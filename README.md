# Python-Bootcamp

Programming - it is more like a instructions given to the computers
Making chai -> Gather water, Milk, tea leaves, sugar, utensils - Collection of data
check conditions - something like enough water & precise instructions
finally, How do actually make the tea
Steps:
Lets go ahead and try some of the steps
step:1 check if kettle has water
step:2 plug in kettle, boil water
step:3 I would get the clean cup
step:4 Add tea leaves and sugar to cup
after that I would add something more probably, Pour boiled water into the cup

convert these steps into the python programme

Python intro:
Lets explore more about the python
class consists of the methods or funtcions
object: what is an object ?

properties cup colour, chai sweetness

methods actions -> stir,pour, drink




class chai:
   def __init__(self, sweetness, milk_level):
         self.sweetness = sweetness
         self.milk_level = milk_level
     def sip(self):
          print("sipping chai")
     def add_sugar(self, amunt)
           print("adding the sugar")
